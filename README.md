# EnhancedTableLayouter
Adds a two-dimensional chart layout to certain games where there are multiple groups containing the same chart list, allowing you to easily see and update your records in every group for a single chart name.

# ChartHighlighter
Provides a pre-fab list of options users can choose from to highlight charts on game pages based on certain heuristics. Useful for easily colour-coding charts you've already submitted, are already first in, or have met some standardised goal/target score. The example image below is configured to highlight all scores above 50, for which there is an in-game achievement.

# StaffTools
**Unless you have Game Moderator permissions this is useless to you.** Adds an auto-pick button to the Edit Entity Locks menu, which will automatically apply an entity lock of the currently-selected entity to every chart in the game with a name matching the name of that entity.
